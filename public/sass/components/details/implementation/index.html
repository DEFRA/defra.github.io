<p>Firefox uses display: list-item to show the arrow marker for the summary
element.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we want to use <code>display: inline-block</code> to 'shrink-wrap' the focus
outline around the summary text, which means that the arrow no longer shows up.</p>
<p>Previously in GOV.UK Elements we resolved this by targeting Firefox specifically
and reverting to <code>display: list-item</code>:</p>
<pre><code>@-moz-document regexp('.*') {
  details summary:not([tabindex]) {
    // Allow duplicate properties, override the summary display property
    // scss-lint:disable DuplicateProperty
    display: list-item;
    display: revert;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, <code>@-moz-document</code> has been removed in Firefox nightly as of 29th Nov
2017 so with this in mind we have taken a different approach, hiding the
browser's marker and injecting and styling our own one across all browsers
instead.</p>
<p>This also gives us more control over the styling of the marker, allowing us for
example to align the summary and disclosed text correctly across all browsers.</p>
<p>The downside of this approach is that older browsers that require a polyfill for
the details element will display the marker even when Javascript is disabled.
Whilst this is not perfect, it is a cosmetic issue and the user will still be
able to access the disclosed content.</p>
<p>For the arrows themselves, we originally tried using unicode glyphs â€“
specifically \25B6 (Black right-pointing triangle) and 25BC (Black down-pointing
triangle) but Android insists on substituting the the former for an emoji even
when the \00FE0E modifier is applied. Sad face.</p>
<p>Hence the border-based triangles we are using today.</p>
